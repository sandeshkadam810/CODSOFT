# CODSOFT
Worked on these 5 projects as a part codsoft data science internship.
1. Titanic Survival Prediction
Predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. This project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building classification models to estimate survival chances.

2. Movie Rating Prediction
Build a regression model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors. This project explores data analysis, preprocessing, and machine learning techniques to develop a model that can accurately estimate movie ratings from historical data.

3. Iris Flower Classification
Classify iris flowers into three species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. This project uses the Iris dataset for training a machine learning model to perform species classification with high accuracy.

4. Sales Prediction Using Python
Forecast future sales of a product by analyzing factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. This project involves using machine learning techniques to predict sales and optimize advertising strategies for businesses.

5. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Identify fraudulent credit card transactions by building a classification model. This project includes preprocessing transaction data, handling class imbalance, and training algorithms like logistic regression or random forests to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions. The model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
